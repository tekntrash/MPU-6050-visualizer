# MPU-6050-visualizer
This repo is an introductory demo of the MPU-6050 Accelerometer &amp; Gyroscope Module using RVIZ

The MPU6050 is a motion tracking device commonly used in robotic applications. It  detects changes in acceleration, rotation, and angular position. It's made up of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, a thermometer (in some models) and a Digital Motion Processor (DMP). This last module processes the data from the sensors and provides it in a simple format, which simplifies programming and reduces the computational load on the host proecssor. The MPU is often used attached to each of the moving parts of a robot such as legs, arms, torso, etc in order to provide data on the movement of those parts.
